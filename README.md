# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification


## 📌 Overview
This project is a **deep learning-based application** built using **TensorFlow and Streamlit**, designed to classify plant diseases by analyzing leaf images. The model can identify and diagnose multiple plant diseases for **potato, tomato, and pepper** plants. 🌱🍅🌶️

## 🚀 Features
- 📷 **Upload leaf images** for disease classification.
- 🔍 **AI-powered detection** using a trained **CNN model**.
- 🎨 **Modern UI** built with **Streamlit**.
- 📊 **Confidence Score** for classification accuracy.
- 🌐 **Fast & easy to use**.

## 📁 Dataset
The model is trained on the **PlantVillage dataset**, which includes labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow / Keras** 🤖
- **OpenCV & NumPy** 📷
- **Streamlit** 🖥️
- **Pandas & Matplotlib** 📊

## 🏗️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmedmoria/Plant-Disease-Classification.git
cd Plant-Disease-Classification
```
2️⃣ Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3️⃣ Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🖼️ Usage
1. **Upload an image** of a plant leaf.
2. **Model predicts** whether the plant is **healthy** or has a disease.
3. **View classification results** with a confidence score.
